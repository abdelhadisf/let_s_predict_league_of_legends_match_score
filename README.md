1. Introduction
League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game
developed and published by Riot Games. Released in 2009, the game involves two
teams of five players each, who compete to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, the
core structure within their base. Each player controls a unique character, known as a
"champion," with special abilities and attributes.
The game is played on a map called "Summoner's Rift," divided into three lanes (top,
mid, and bottom), with a jungle area in between. Players gain gold and experience by
killing minions, monsters, and opposing champions, allowing them to purchase items
and level up their abilities. Strategic coordination and teamwork are essential to
achieving victory.
This report serves as a comprehensive documentation of the findings, methodologies,
and analyses conducted during the Machine Learning and Data Mining project. The
primary aim of this project was to investigate and analyze a dataset from the domain
of e-sports, focusing specifically on League of Legends matches. Through the
application of various machine learning techniques, the objective was to predict match
outcomes based on game-specific features and uncover underlying patterns within
the data.
The overarching goals of this project include, but are not limited to, the following:
Performing thorough preprocessing of the raw data to enhance its quality and ensure
optimal input for machine learning models.
Implementing a diverse range of machine learning methodologies, encompassing
both supervised and unsupervised approaches, to analyze the dataset effectively.
Conducting a comparative evaluation of the implemented models to identify strengths,
weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
By achieving these objectives, the project aims to demonstrate the potential of
machine learning techniques in extracting meaningful insights and providing
actionable recommendations within the context of competitive e-sports.
